Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Control Tesla from my computer

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
My husband and I recently got a Tesla model 3. I want to write a program that will allow me to control the car, lock/unlock, set climate control, etc from my computer.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I will learn more about requests and APIs, and if there is extra time, create a graphical interface using html/css or tkinter.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
requests

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
yes

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
yes
