This is a terminal application for controlling a tesla vehicle.
It allow you to view information about your car's current status, as well as executing commands to make your car do things.
I used the unofficial tesla JSON API. https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/
You will need to obtain a bearer key using your tesla username and password (good for 1 month) for your vehicle in order to use this.
